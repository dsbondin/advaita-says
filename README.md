## Advaita Says

This app is my final project for Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at Flatiron School. It is written using React/Redux with Rails API backend. The app will display to you some random quotes by Nisargadatta Maharaj. If you like the quote you can save it to your collection. Or you can add one using the 'New Quote' form.
